# lib*isaac*

This project is inspired by the relatively trendy wave of making your program 
functions into a platform-agnostic library that does all the grunt work in 
the background and building a specialized GUI for each platform independently. 
This has the advantage of integrating much more with a platform if native 
toolkits are used.

[A previous attempt](https://github.com/PetricaT/IsaacMM) was made, where QT was used thanks to the wide platform 
support it brings, but nothing beats native.
